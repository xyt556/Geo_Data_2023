RasterIO

RasterIO is a Python library that provides access to geospatial raster data using the GDAL and Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) bindings.
Installation

You can install RasterIO using pip:

pip install rasterio

Usage

To use RasterIO, you first need to import the library:

python

import rasterio

Then, you can open a raster file using the open function:

python

with rasterio.open("path/to/raster.tif") as dataset:
    # access raster data

You can read and write raster data using the read and write methods:

python

data = dataset.read(1)  # read the first band
dataset.write(data, 1)  # write the data to the first band

You can also access the metadata of the raster file using the meta attribute:

python

meta = dataset.meta  # get the metadata

RasterIO also provides a number of convenience functions for working with raster data, including transforming coordinates between different coordinate reference systems, reprojecting raster data, and masking raster data.
Conclusion

RasterIO provides a powerful and flexible interface for working with geospatial raster data in Python. Whether you are working with satellite imagery, digital elevation models, or any other kind of geospatial raster data, RasterIO makes it easy to read, write, and manipulate data.
